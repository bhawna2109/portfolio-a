              <p>A technology and design enthusiast who loves to design and build things that people want, I hold a Bachelor of Design degree with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati.<br><br>

                I believe in designing humane software, particularly time-respectful products. Understanding what users want, and accelerating their behaviour with regards for their reasons is something I feel is worth striving for, especially today, as the number of apps, games, and websites continue to grow exponentially.<br><br>
                
                Creating thoughtful experiences by understanding the user, and the technology is a rewarding task for me. I believe that we need simpler, more intuitive, humane, engaging, and usable experiences for new innovations involving complex technology.</p>
